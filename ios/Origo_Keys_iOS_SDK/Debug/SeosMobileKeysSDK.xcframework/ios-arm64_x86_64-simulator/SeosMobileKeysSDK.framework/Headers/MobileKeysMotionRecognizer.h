/**
 * @note iOS Only
 *
 * Implementation of the ASSA ABLOY patented Twist and Go motion. The user turns his phone in one direction
 * and then back again, simulating turning a door knob.
 *
 * Since version 7.0.0, the usage has changed slightly, the main reason for this is to preserve resources and minimize memory allocation
 * overhead.
 *
 * From version 7.0.0, use -[MobileKeysMotionRecognizer startTrackingRotation] to start the thread that monitors twist & go movements. To pause tracking, use
 * -[MobileKeysMotionRecognizer pauseTrackingRotation] and to resume trtacking use -[MobileKeysMotionRecognizer resumeTrackingRotation].
 *
 * @warning Opening the closest reader using Twist and Go is already supported by the SDK. Simply pass
 * `+[MobileKeysOpeningType MobileKeysOpeningTypeMotion]` as a one of the values in the array of `supportedOpeningTypes`
 * when calling `-[MobileKeysManager startReaderScanInMode:supportedOpeningTypes:lockServiceCodes:error:]`.
 * You (the integrator) should only use this class if the default Twist and Go opening implementation in the SDK does not cover
 * your specific use case.
 *
 * @note to preserve power, please use the `-[MobileKeysMotionRecognizer pauseTrackingRotation]` and
 * `-[MobileKeysMotionRecognizer resumeTrackingRotation]` when your use case does not mandate that the Twist and Go
 * motion pattern shouldn't be detected.

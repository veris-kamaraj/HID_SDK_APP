 This method triggers whenever a user exits a designated zone.  However, to prevent excessive notifications due to user location fluctuations at the zone boundary, a delay mechanism is implemented:

 Enterprise Approach: A 30-second delay exists between the time a user leaves the zone and the method trigger.
 Premium Approach: A more flexible delay of 30 seconds to 2 minutes is implemented.
 This delay helps to filter out transient zone entries/exits that might occur when a user lingers near the edge of the beacon's signal range.

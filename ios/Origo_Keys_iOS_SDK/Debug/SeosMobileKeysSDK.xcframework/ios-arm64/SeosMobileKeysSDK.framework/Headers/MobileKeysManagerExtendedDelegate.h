/**
* IMPORTANT: Only implement this callback method if you absolutely need scan results for all Readers.
* If this method is NOT implemented, the SDK assumes that it returns YES. See below.
* This is a callback method  for each advertisement the SDK receives from all seen readers in the vicinity.
* If this callback is implemented, the SDK will call this function for each and every RSSI value measurement,
* which could impact battery consumption of your application.
*
* When this method in implemented and returns NO, the SDK will not run its internal Opening Triggers for this particular
* MobileKeysReader RSSI measurement. In practice, this means that the Reader will be ignored.
* If this method is implemented and returns YES, the SDK will process the RSSI values.
* If this method is NOT IMPLEMENTED, the SDK will assume that the response was YES.
*
* Possible use cases for this method includes but is not limited to:
*  - Custom opening triggers (e.g. custom RSSI value analysis etc)
*  - Disabling SDK built-in unlock mechanisms temporarily, while at the same time the SDK keeps scanning.
*
*
* @return NO id the MobileKeysReader should be ignored, otherwise YES
* @warning This is a low-level method that should only be implemented for custom opening behaviors,
* i.e. not one of the types in `MobileKeysOpeningType`.
* @param mobileKeysReader - The reader that sent the advertisement
* @note since version 5.1
* @note This is an optional method
